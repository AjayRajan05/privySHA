# Support

ASHA is an open-source **developer preview** (`0.4.x`). This document is the support policy for the public project.

## Support policy (preview)

- **Best-effort, community-driven.** Maintainers triage Issues and Discussions when available; there is **no SLA** and **no paid support contract** for the open-source package.
- **Pin versions** for pilots (`asha==0.4.2`). Preview APIs may change within `0.4.x` with CHANGELOG notes.
- **Default install** is lite (`pip install asha-ai`). Hardened models and framework adapters are optional extras — see [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) and [docs/anchor.md](docs/anchor.md).
- **Security reports** follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) (acknowledge within 48 hours; status update within 7 days — target, not a guarantee).
- **Out of scope:** debugging third-party LLM providers, private forks without a minimal repro, or requesting managed/cloud hosting (not offered).

## What to include in a report

1. ASHA version (`python -c "import asha; print(asha.__version__)"`)
2. Python version and OS
3. Install extras used (`asha-ai[hardened]`, `asha-ai[anchor]`, …)
4. Minimal reproduction (code + expected vs actual)
5. Whether `ASHA_DISABLE_ML` / `ASHA_DISABLE_MODEL_DOWNLOAD` / `ASHA_MODELS_DIR` are set

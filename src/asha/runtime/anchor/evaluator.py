"""Mission-alignment scoring for ANCHOR actions.

Hard-block signals (forbidden action, resource-scope violation, high-risk
tool under local-only) force score → 0.0 so no combination of medium-confidence
penalties can average up into a false ALLOW. Soft multiplicative penalties
remain for non-hard policy mismatches.

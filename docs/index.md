# ASHA Documentation

ASHA is a Python library for **mission-aware agent governance** and **drop-in prompt security**. Use `anchor()` to keep autonomous agents aligned with the user's goal, and `process()` / `wrap_llm()` to mask PII, check injection patterns, and compress prompts before they reach a model.

!!! warning "Developer preview (v0.4.2)"
    Pre-1.0 — APIs may change. Install with `pip install asha-ai` (lite path; no API key or model download).
    See **[status.md](status.md)** for what works vs preview vs experimental. Pin a version only when you need a frozen pilot.

## Tutorial

Learning-oriented — one path from install to a working result.

- **[Tutorial](tutorial.md)** — install ASHA, process a prompt, wrap a client, govern a mock agent

## How-to guides

Task-oriented — solve one problem when you already know the basics.

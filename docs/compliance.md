# Compliance

**ASHA v0.4.2** - privacy tooling, not a certified compliance product.

---

## What ASHA provides

- PII detection and masking before LLM calls
- Configurable fail-closed mode (`mode="strict"`)
- Audit-friendly typed results (`ProcessResult.security`, traces)
- Local preprocessing without sending raw PII to cloud models (when self-hosted)

---

## What ASHA does not provide

- Legal compliance certification (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)
- Data processing agreements or audit reports
- Guaranteed detection of all PII in all locales
- Replacement for organizational privacy policies

---

## Recommended practices

1. **Pin the version** - `asha==0.4.2`
2. **Use `mode="strict"`** for regulated paths where failure must block
3. **Prefer `wrap_llm()`** over `auto_patch()` for scoped control
4. **Log `result.degraded`** in balanced mode - indicates fallback was used
5. **Review mask formats** - `[EMAIL_HASH]_*` tokens, not reversible by default
6. **Combine with org controls** - access policies, retention, DPA with LLM vendor

---

## Reversible masking

Only enable when you have a documented need to restore values in LLM output:

```python
from asha.core.policy_config import PolicyConfig
sanitize(prompt, policy=PolicyConfig(reversible=True))
```

Store `masking_map` securely - it can reverse pseudonymization.

---

## Data residency

`process()` and `sanitize()` run locally. LLM calls via `Agent` or `wrap_llm` send **processed** prompts to the provider you configure.
